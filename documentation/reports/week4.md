# Week 4

## Weekly report

This week I implemented the functionality for converting messages from integers into strings and vice versa. In practice this means that messages can now be written in plaintext for encryption and the same message will be displayed after decryption. Only ASCII characters are supported so messages should be simple and not contain any exotic characters.

I finally got to properly writing automated tests for the program.

I am aware of several issues with the program and will be working to fix them next week. For example, the program won't work properly if the message is too long.
