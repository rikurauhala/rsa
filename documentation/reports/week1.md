# Week 1

## Weekly report

During the first course week I attended the starting lecture on campus. I really struggled with choosing the topic for my project but decided to go with the RSA cryptosystem. I didn't have much time to look into the technical details yet, but initially the topic seems challenging enough, yet doable with sufficient time and effort.

I mostly focused on the documentation and setting up the project. Python was an easy choice for the programming language as I am most familiar with it and know how to write tests and possibly build a GUI with it. Perhaps it's not the most suitable option for a *datastructures and algorithms* related project when it comes to speed, but as far as I know, Python can handle large numbers well. That should be a useful property as 1024-bit prime numbers will be needed to calculate the keys.

The plan for the next week is look more into the details of the implementation and start coding.
