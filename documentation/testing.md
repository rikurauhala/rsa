# Testing

## Overview

Automated tests has been written using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x). A test coverage report can be generated with [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.5.0/).

## Unit testing

### Running unit tests

```bash
# Tests can be run with the command
$ poetry run invoke test
```

### Test coverage

```bash
# Test coverage can be checked with the command
$ poetry run invoke coverage

# A test coverage report can be generated with the command
$ poetry run invoke coverage-report

# The coverage report can be viewed by opening it
# with a web browser, for example Mozilla Firefox
$ firefox htmlcov/index.html
```

## Performance testing

Performance tests have been implemented in a separate module and they can be found in the file `src/performance.py`. The performance of the application is tested by comparing it to [another implementation](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa) with the same input parameters. The add-on [pytest-benchmark](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is used for benchmarking.

### Running the performance test

```bash
# The performance test can be run with the following command
# Please be patient as it may take some time to finish
$ poetry run invoke performance-test
```

### Results

The following results were generated by running the performance test. The resulting output has been converted into a Markdown table for this document, but the content remains the same. Let's go over the results one by one. *Own* refers to my implementation and *rsa* refers to the rsa module. The three main functions supported my program were benchmarked: key generation, encryption and decryption.

#### Key generation

Key generation was tested with the same parameters: a key length of 1024 bits and 100 rounds of testing. Looking at the mean and the median values for the different test runs, my implementation would appear to be slower, almost twice as slow as the rsa module. Based on these results, my implementation of the key generation process could optimized.

#### Encryption

When it comes to encryption, my implementation would appear to be faster. Without looking into the source code of the rsa module, I would assume this is because my program only supports a very limited set of characters, thus it does not take long for the conversion process to take place.

#### Decryption

In the case of decryption however, my implementation runs considerably slower.
