# Project specification

## Overview

The application will implement the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) algorithm in the **Python** programming language. Keys should be generated in the program and have a length of at least 1024 bits, as instructed in the course material. The program will have a command-line interface, possibly a graphical user interface (GUI) later on if there is enough time for that.

The program should offer functionality for generating both public and private keys and functionality for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Meta

I chose Python as the programming language as it is the language I am most familiar and most comfortable with. For peer review, I also know enough **Java** and **JavaScript**. Even though I am a native Finnish speaker, I chose to write all documentation in English, as my GitHub is also part of my professional portfolio and everything I do on the platform is already in English. I am hoping to include this project in my portfolio and would have to translate the documentation into English eventually anyway.

I am third-year student in the bachelor's programme in computer science (*Tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandiohjelma*) as the University of Helsinki.
