# Project specification

## Overview

The application will implement the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) algorithm in the **Python** programming language. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) will be used for installing and managing dependencies. Keys should be generated in the program and have a length of at least 1024 bits, as instructed in the course material. The program will have a command-line interface, possibly a graphical user interface (GUI) later on if there is enough time for that.

## Purpose

The purpose of the application is to provide a way to encrypt and decrypt messages with the RSA cryptosystem. In the context of this course, the goal is to learn and implement all relevant algorithms to make this work.

## Functionality

The program should offer functionality for generating both public and private keys and functionality for encrypting and decrypting messages. The program should receive a public key and a plaintext message as *input* when encrypting, and the private key and a ciphered message when decrypting. *Output* could be written into a file in addition to the terminal for easier access and improved usability.

## Meta

I am very interested in information security and cryptography. Getting familiar with an actual algorithm during this course will be an interesting way to boost my knowledge on the subject. I chose RSA to work on as it was mentioned in the course material and seems to be complicated and challenging enough as a topic.

Python was chosen as the programming language as it is the language I am most familiar and most comfortable with. For peer review, I also know enough **Java** and **JavaScript**. Even though I am a native Finnish speaker, I made the decision to write all documentation **in English**, as my GitHub profile is also part of my professional portfolio and everything I do on the platform is already in English. I am hoping to include this project in my portfolio and would have to translate the documentation into English eventually anyway.

I am third-year student in the bachelor's programme in computer science (*Tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandiohjelma*) at the University of Helsinki.
